# Animals  
### Description  
The project loops through an array of objects containing information about various animals of three kinds, dogs, cats, and dinos, and builds cards featuring the animals' information.  
On page load, all animals' cards are printed to the DOM.  
Also on page load, four buttons appear labeled All, Cat, Dog, and Dino.  
By selecting one of these buttons, the user triggers event handlers which, if a type of animal is selected, forms an array only of that type's objects and prints those cards to the dom, or, if `all` is pressed, reverts the page to show all animals.
